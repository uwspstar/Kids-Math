# recursive formula for an arithmetic sequence for an 8th grader.

### What is an Arithmetic Sequence?

First, we need to understand what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is always the same. This constant difference is called the "common difference" and is often represented by \(d\).

For example, in the sequence \(2, 5, 8, 11, \ldots\), the common difference \(d\) is \(3\).

### Recursive Formula

A recursive formula is a way to represent a sequence by expressing each term as a function of its preceding term. In other words, to get the next term in the sequence, you apply a certain rule to the term before it.

### Recursive Formula for Arithmetic Sequence:

For an arithmetic sequence, the recursive formula can be given as:
\[ a_{n} = a_{n-1} + d \]

Where:
- \( a_{n} \) is the \( n^{th} \) term of the sequence.
- \( a_{n-1} \) is the term before the \( n^{th} \) term, i.e., the \( (n-1)^{th} \) term.
- \( d \) is the common difference.

### Key Points:

1. **Start Point**: The first term, \( a_1 \), is often given to you. It's the starting point of the sequence. For example, if \( a_1 = 2 \), the sequence might start like \( 2, \ldots \).

2. **Apply the Rule**: To get the next term, you add the common difference. If you know the second term and want to find the third term, you add the common difference to the second term. 

3. **Keep Going**: To find the next term, you always look at the term before it and add the common difference.

### Example:

Given:
- First term \( a_1 = 2 \)
- Common difference \( d = 3 \)

Using the recursive formula:
1. First term: \( a_1 = 2 \)
2. Second term: \( a_2 = a_1 + d = 2 + 3 = 5 \)
3. Third term: \( a_3 = a_2 + d = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
4. And so on...

So the sequence starts 2, 5, 8, 11,...

### Practice Activity:

You can create a small activity for your son to practice:

1. Provide him with a first term and a common difference.
2. Ask him to use the recursive formula to find the next 4 terms.
3. Repeat with different values to ensure understanding.

Understanding the recursive nature of the sequence can help in grasping the concept better. Remember to encourage questions and provide plenty of examples!
