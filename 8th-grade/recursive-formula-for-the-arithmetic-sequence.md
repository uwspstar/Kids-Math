# Recursive formula for an arithmetic sequence for an 8th grader.

### What is an Arithmetic Sequence?

First, we need to understand what an arithmetic sequence is. `An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is always the same`. This `constant difference` is called the "common difference" and is often represented by \(d\).

For example, in the sequence \(2, 5, 8, 11, \ldots\), the common difference \(d\) is \(3\).

### Recursive Formula

A `recursive formula` is a way to represent a sequence by expressing each term as a function of its preceding term. In other words, to get `the next term in the sequence, you apply a certain rule to the term before it`.

### Recursive Formula for Arithmetic Sequence:

For an arithmetic sequence, the recursive formula can be given as:
\[ a_{n} = a_{n-1} + d \]

Where:
- \( a_{n} \) is the \( n^{th} \) term of the sequence.
- \( a_{n-1} \) is the term before the \( n^{th} \) term, i.e., the \( (n-1)^{th} \) term.
- \( d \) is the common difference.

### Key Points:

1. **Start Point**: The first term, \( a_1 \), is often given to you. It's the starting point of the sequence. For example, if \( a_1 = 2 \), the sequence might start like \( 2, \ldots \).

2. **Apply the Rule**: To get the next term, you add the common difference. If you know the second term and want to find the third term, you add the common difference to the second term. 

3. **Keep Going**: To find the next term, you always look at the term before it and add the common difference.

### Example:

Given:
- First term \( a_1 = 2 \)
- Common difference \( d = 3 \)

Using the recursive formula:
1. First term: \( a_1 = 2 \)
2. Second term: \( a_2 = a_1 + d = 2 + 3 = 5 \)
3. Third term: \( a_3 = a_2 + d = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
4. And so on...

So the sequence starts 2, 5, 8, 11,...

### 什么是算术序列？

首先，我们需要了解算术序列是什么。算术序列是一个数字序列，其中`连续项之间的差异总是相同的`。这个常数差异被称为"公差"，通常用 \(d\) 表示。

例如，在序列 \(2, 5, 8, 11, \ldots\) 中，公差 \(d\) 是 \(3\)。

### 递归公式

`递归公式`是表示序列的一种方法，通过将`每一项表示为其前一项的函数`来表示。换句话说，为了得到序列中的下一个项，你需要对前一个项应用某个规则。

### 算术序列的递归公式：

对于算术序列，递归公式可以表示为：
\[ a_{n} = a_{n-1} + d \]

其中：
- \( a_{n} \) 是序列的第 \( n^{th} \) 项。
- \( a_{n-1} \) 是第 \( n^{th} \) 项之前的项，即第 \( (n-1)^{th} \) 项。
- \( d \) 是公差。

### 关键点：

1. **起始点**：通常会给出第一项， \( a_1 \)。它是序列的起始点。例如，如果 \( a_1 = 2 \)，那么序列可能从 \( 2, \ldots \) 开始。

2. **应用规则**：为了得到下一个项，你需要加上公差。如果你知道第二项，并想找到第三项，你需要在第二项的基础上加上公差。

3. **继续下去**：为了找到下一个项，你总是看前一个项并加上公差。

### 例子：

给定：
- 第一项 \( a_1 = 2 \)
- 公差 \( d = 3 \)

使用递归公式：
1. 第一项: \( a_1 = 2 \)
2. 第二项: \( a_2 = a_1 + d = 2 + 3 = 5 \)
3. 第三项: \( a_3 = a_2 + d = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
4. 以此类推...

所以序列开始为 2, 5, 8, 11,...

### 练习活动：

你可以为你的儿子创建一个小活动来练习：

1. 给他提供一个第一项和一个公差。
2. 要求他使用递归公式找到接下来的4个项。
3. 使用不同的值重复以确保理解。

Sure, I'll create 5 questions each for medium, hard, and SAT level related to arithmetic sequences and provide detailed solutions in both English and Chinese.

### Medium Level:

1. **Question**: Find the 5th term in the arithmetic sequence 2, 5, 8, ...?

   **Solution**:
   - English: Use the formula \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d\). Here, \(a_1 = 2\), \(d = 3\), and \(n = 5\). Therefore, \(a_5 = 2 + 4 \times 3 = 14\).
   - Chinese: 使用公式 \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d\)。这里，\(a_1 = 2\)，\(d = 3\)，并且 \(n = 5\)。因此，\(a_5 = 2 + 4 \times 3 = 14\)。

2. **Question**: The 3rd term in an arithmetic sequence is 9, and the 7th term is 21. What is the first term?

   **Solution**:
   - English: From the information, \(a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 9\) and \(a_7 = a_1 + 6d = 21\). Solving, we get \(d = 3\) and \(a_1 = 3\).
   - Chinese: 根据信息，\(a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 9\) 和 \(a_7 = a_1 + 6d = 21\)。解答得到 \(d = 3\) 和 \(a_1 = 3\)。

3. **Question**: How many terms are there in the arithmetic sequence 4, 7, 10, ... 31?

   **Solution**:
   - English: Using \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d\), with \(a_n = 31\), \(a_1 = 4\), and \(d = 3\), we solve for \(n = 10\).
   - Chinese: 使用 \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d\)，其中 \(a_n = 31\)，\(a_1 = 4\)，并且 \(d = 3\)，我们求得 \(n = 10\)。

4. **Question**: An arithmetic sequence has first term 3 and common difference 5. What is the 6th term?

   **Solution**:
   - English: Using \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d\), with \(a_1 = 3\), \(d = 5\), and \(n = 6\), we get \(a_6 = 28\).
   - Chinese: 使用公式 \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d\)，其中 \(a_1 = 3\)，\(d = 5\)，并且 \(n = 6\)，我们得到 \(a_6 = 28\)。

5. **Question**: What is the common difference for the arithmetic sequence 6, 10, 14, ...?

   **Solution**:
   - English: The common difference \(d\) is given by the difference between two consecutive terms. So, \(d = 10 - 6 = 4\).
   - Chinese: 等差序列的公差 \(d\) 由两个连续项之间的差给出。所以，\(d = 10 - 6 = 4\)。

### Hard Level:

(Note: Questions in this category might involve more advanced algebraic manipulations.)

1. **Question**: The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by \(S_n = 2n^2 + 3n\). What is the first term?

   **Solution**:
   - English: The nth term \(a_n\) is \(S_n - S_{n-1}\). Setting \(n=1\), we find \(a_1 = 2(1^2) + 3(1) - 0 = 5\).
   - Chinese: 第n项 \(a_n\) 是 \(S_n - S_{n-1}\)。设置 \(n=1\)，我们找到 \(a_1 = 2(1^2) + 3(1) - 0 = 5\)。

2. **Question**: An arithmetic sequence has first term 2 and last term 50. If the sum of all terms is 260, how many terms are there?

   **Solution**:
   - English: Using the formula \(S_n = n/2 (a_1 + a_n)\), we have \(260 = n/2 (2 + 50)\). Solving for n, we get \(n = 8\).
   - Chinese: 使用公式 \(S_n = n/2 (a_1 + a_n)\)，我们得到 \(260 = n/2 (2 + 50)\)。求解 n，我们得到 \(n = 8\)。

3. **Question**: The 5th term of an arithmetic sequence is 3 times the 2nd term. If the 5th term is 14, find the first term.

   **Solution**:
   - English: Given \(a_5 = 3a_2\) and \(a_5 = 14\). Using \(a_2 = a_1 + d\), we get \(a_1 = 4\).
   - Chinese: 已知 \(a_5 = 3a_2\) 并且 \(a_5 = 14\)。使用 \(a_2 = a_1 + d\)，我们得到 \(a_1 = 4\)。

4. **Question**: The sum of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence is 15, and the product is 45. Find the terms.

   **Solution**:
   - English: Let the terms be \(a-d\), \(a\), and \(a+d\). From given conditions, solve for \(a = 5\) and \(d = 2\). So, the terms are 3, 5, and 7.
   - Chinese: 让这三个项为 \(a-d\)，\(a\) 和 \(a+d\)。根据给定条件，求解得 \(a = 5\) 和 \(d = 2\)。所以，这些项为 3, 5, 和 7。

5. **Question**: In an arithmetic sequence, the 6th term minus the 4th term is 10. The common difference is 5. Find the first term.

   **Solution**:
   - English: Given \(a_6 - a_4 = 10\) and \(d = 5\), we solve for \(a_1 = -3\).
   - Chinese: 已知 \(a_6 - a_4 = 10\) 并且 \(d = 5\)，我们可以求出 \(a_1 = -3\)。

### SAT Level:

(Note: Questions in this category test understanding and often involve word problems.)

1. **Question**: A farmer grows his yield by the same amount every year. In the 3rd year, he produced 120 bushels, and in the 6th year, he produced 165 bushels. How much did he produce in the 1st year?

   **Solution**:
   - English: Using \(a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 120\) and \(a_6 = a_1 + 5d = 165\), we solve to get \(d = 15\) and \(a_1 = 90\).
   - Chinese: 使用 \(a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 120\) 和 \(a_6 = a_1 + 5d = 165\)，我们求解得到 \(d = 15\) 和 \(a_1 = 90\)。

2. **Question**: In an arithmetic sequence, the sum of the first 10 terms is 50, and the sum of the next 10 terms is 150. Find the common difference.

   **Solution**:
   - English: Given \(S_{10} = 50\) and \(S_{20} - S_{10} = 150\). We find \(d = 5\).
   - Chinese: 已知 \(S_{10} = 50\) 和 \(S_{20} - S_{10} = 150\)，我们可以求出 \(d = 5\)。

3. **Question**: The average of four consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence is 7. If the common difference is 2, find the first of these four terms.

   **Solution**:
   - English: Let the terms be \(a\), \(a+2\), \(a+4\), and \(a+6\). Their average is 7, so \(a + (a+2) + (a+4) + (a+6) = 28\). Solve for \(a = 4\).
   - Chinese: 让这四个项为 \(a\)，\(a+2\)，\(a+4\)，和 \(a+6\)。他们的平均值是 7，所以 \(a + (a+2) + (a+4) + (a+6) = 28\)。求解得到 \(a = 4\)。

4. **Question**: A sequence starts with the term 5 and has a common difference of -3. Which term of the sequence is the first negative term?

   **Solution**:
   - English: The nth term is given by \(a_n = 5 - 3(n-1)\). Set \(a_n < 0\) and solve for the smallest n. We get \(n = 3\).
   - Chinese: 这个序列的第n项由 \(a_n = 5 - 3(n-1)\) 给出。设定 \(a_n < 0\) 并求解最小的 n。我们得到 \(n = 3\)。

5. **Question**: A sequence has a first term of 3. The 5th term is twice the second term. Find the common difference.

   **Solution**:
   - English: Given \(a_5 = 2a_2\). Using the formula \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\), we find \(d = 2\).
   - Chinese: 已知 \(a_5 = 2a_2\)。使用公式 \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\)，我们得到 \(d = 2\)。

I hope these questions and their detailed solutions will be helpful. Remember, understanding the core concepts is key; once your grasp on the foundational principles is strong, solving even the most complex problems becomes simpler.
